I currently work as an Engineer at [CRNL](https://www.crnl.fr/fr/equipe/memo-idex-fellowship), 
building EEG data processing and analysis pipelines for the [Memo](https://www.memoteam.org/)
Team interested in probabilistic learning.

I have a solid programming background in Python, that comes from 2+ years of
working in industry experience. During that period I learnt the principles
about building scalable data pipelines and storing data in a format that is
easily accessible and maintainable. I am trying to use this data and software
oriented knowledge in my everyday tasks at the Memo Team.

I am an advocate of (M)EEG data processing with an ambition towards scalability
and reproducibility. I try to push my boundaries, learn new technologies and
remember to look up at the stars and not down at my feet.
